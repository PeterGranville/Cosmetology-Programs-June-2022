# Cosmetology-Programs-June-2022

This repository contains the code needed to reproduce TCF's original data analysis in its June 2022 report on cosmetology programs. This code is located in the R Markdown file named "TCF Analysis of Cosmetology Programs.Rmd". 

All the data files used in this analysis are too large to be stored in the GitHub repository, so they must be downloaded by the user to fully reproduce TCF's analysis. Four data sources are used. 

The first source is IPEDS, and all IPEDS .csv file names in this document indicate the specific data file downloaded from the IPEDS online portal. The link is here: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?gotoReportId=7&fromIpeds=true&

The next source is the College Scorecard. We use the full, most recent (as of June 2022) program-level and institution-level data sets, which can be downloaded here: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

The third source is the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. We use the 1-year PUMS sample reflecting calendar year 2019. The data files can be downloaded from this site in the "csv_pus.zip" file: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2019/1-Year/

Finally, we  use the data on Gainful Employment released in March 2022 by the Department of Education. This is available at the following link, courtesy of the New America Foundation: https://www.newamerica.org/documents/7232/GE_Information_Rates_Data_03-15-22_FINAL.xlsx
